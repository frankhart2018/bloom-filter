# Bloom Filter Python

The primary implementation is done in `bloom.py`, but the two different experiments are done in the jupyter notebook called `bloom-filter-results.ipynb`. This consists of two different experiments:

1. Where the size of bloom filter is fixed and the number of hash functions applied is varied.
2. Where the number of hash functions is fixed and the size of the bloom filter is varied.

The results are presented in neat graphs in the notebook.

## Usage

1. Run jupyter lab or jupyter notebook instance:

```bash
user@programmer~:$ jupyter-notebook
```

And that's it, you can either see already saved results or re-run the cells yourself to verify the results.
